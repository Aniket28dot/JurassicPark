            Welcome to the World of Adventures!!
            <p>I am Aniket Bhatia, fresher at Nit Kurukshetra, pursuing B.tech in Computer Engineering. I am learning Web Development for the past 2.5 months. Web designing always fascinated me, the astonishing UI of different websites increased my zeal to learn and follow this amazing field. I am handy with the frontend part of web development which includes HTML, CSS and JS but want to come at ease with the backened part as well and so I am currently learning Nodejs. Besides this I also like reading books, playing cricket, badminton and listening to great peoples as a part of leisure in my day to day life.</p>
